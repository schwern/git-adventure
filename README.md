See http://blog.schwern.net/2013/02/28/git-text-adventure/ for a first sketch of what this might look like.

At this point there's no code, post [issues](https://github.com/schwern/git-adventure/issues) and use the [wiki](https://github.com/schwern/git-adventure/wiki) to sketch out how what this might look like and how it might work!
